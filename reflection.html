          Quang: For the whole time span of the project, we were very disciplined and detail-oriented with our goals, always setting smaller goals for each aim. For example, we have divided our research into different topics for each member to study each week. Thanks to that, we always know what to stick to throughout the project. As can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/Khang5687/rmit-efly/commits/main">our commit history in the EFly repository</a>, each member mainly worked in one part of the project at a time. However, one thing I hope we could have done better is managing our time. As first-year students, it was a challenge for us to manage a whole project with 3 members, while also keeping up with other academic responsibilities. I was surprised with the amount of work that needs to go into my allocated tasks just so I can keep up with my teammates. There were also times, when following our plans, a member would fall off track. But as we proceed to the final weeks of the semester, we have learned from these experiences and balanced things out to work more efficiently. Most importantly, I have also learned that everyone having different knowledge and expertise is the most valuable asset. Every member can actually learn together and learn from each other to better their skills and knowledge. It is the best aspect of working in a group.

          Ha: In my opinion, what our group did best during the project was managing the timetable and allocating the tasks to each member. We were very precise with our goals each week, and the amount of preparation was beneficial in many ways - most notably, we could measure our progress and what we had learnt by comparing this week’s outcomes to last week’s. One thing that could be improved is our scope at the beginning of the semester. I felt like we had included too many features in the In Scope table without acknowledging the time constraints, which led to more expectations and stress. The most surprising thing I learnt about groups was the amount of time needed for each meeting of the week. As I did not have much experience with group work before, I used to think that group meetings would be quick and painless. However, the reality was that we had to dedicate a lot of time discussing our opinions and ideas before agreeing on a topic. Another thing I have learned and am grateful of is that working in a group means you are not alone with your struggles. Every member can offer help and support when you need it for the greater benefit. In this regard, working together is less stress-inducing than working alone.

          Khang: I find that we were able to quickly identify and resolve arising problems, such as revising the plans during the final weeks. That is one notable thing that went well. One thing that I think could be improved is the flexibility of meetings. We frequently had meetings offline, and that might be reassuring, but it sometimes interferes with my daily routine. We could have done better by having meetings using online call. The best thing I found out is that I felt more responsibility when it comes to working with others. I was much more productive working in a group, which is surprising, as normally, I would always struggle with procrastination working alone. Overall, attempting to build this project has given us the opportunity to experience first hand what it is like planning for an actual IT product, doing the research, and putting the work in to make it a reality. Even though unfortunately the website can not be completed in time due to the overall difficulty compared to our technical knowledge, it was still a very educational and productive experience overall.
