        <p>
          To summarize, so far, we have made progress in the following areas of the project:

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A rough design of the homepage, shopping page and auction page has been made to help every member visualize the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/l6xjfgUY0v4">Youtube link.</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            The backend for a part of the in scope features has been coded. The repository for our project is hosted on Github, and we are constantly updating it. Even though it has a long way to go, we have managed to get a portion of the project done. <a href="https://github.com/Khang5687/rmit-efly">Repository link.</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, since a large portion of what we have done only involves the backend of the code (the mockup video is designed separately using graphic tools to simulate the visuals of EFly), currently we can not provide a product that has an user interface.
<br>However, the features that we have developed up until now are:
        </p>          
<ul>
            <li>
              User system: Including user registration and authentication. User details will be saved in our database.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cart page: Provide a view over the items added to cart.
            </li>
            <li>
              Email functions: Send emails for important notifications, such as authentication, winning an auction, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Product models: We have specified separate product models for items in the shop and items up for auctioning.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Of course, these features are not completed yet, since we would have to make multiple revisions along the way when we continue adding more to the backend and frontend.
<br>For the prototype video, the features showcased include:

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Home page and user login system: Users can register, login, and view the homepage of EFly. A “subscribe to mailing list” option can be seen at the end of the page.

            </li>
            <li>
              Auction page and official shop page: There are two separate sections: auctions and shop. Both showcase the latest items up for sale.
<br>While auction items have attributes such as starting bid, reserve bid, etc.; shop items have the price as normally seen in shopping websites. The items can have a “sold out” status.

            </li>
            <li>
              Adding to cart function, cart view (before checking out): Users can add products to their cart and update the quantity before checking out.

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Even though EFly is not yet complete as of now, we take pride in the fact that we have done our best in implementing our project idea. Our goal in mind is to achieve the first of the three listed aims, which is to complete a functional, usable website with seamless integration of the two shopping features. EFly will become a great way for RMIT students to trade and buy merchandise in a flexible and easy manner.
<br>As detailed in previous sections, EFly is still at a very early stage, especially as we have many ambitions for the website. In fact, we might never really ‘complete’ the project, with the scope of the project expanding over time as we add new features along the way.
<br>However, continuing on with the project, we would like to use the Aims section as a general guideline and develop EFly according to the three most important goals. After a basic website is successfully set up, we will start looking into incorporating new features, as well as ensuring security and customer service. Our ultimate goal is for EFly to be an actual product that can assist our targeted users in a meaningful, tangible way.
