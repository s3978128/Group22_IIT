<p>
    The progress of making the website can be easily seen. The repository was created at the same time we start writing the report, however, we only started adding content into it later on when we have agreed on a good structure for the page.
<br>Parts that are unfinished are pushed to sub branches, and then we will merge it with the main branch later. The Page is deployed using the main branch.
    <br>We had put a navigation bar first before writing the report. This bar will help switching between different sections of the report become more convenient.
<br>The content of the website is identical to that of the report, however, instead of putting the entire content into one page, we have divided it to multiple pages that can easily be navigated using the navigation bar.
<br>We have put effort into using the appropriate HTML and CSS so that the content looks easy on the eyes and best reflects the original report’s PDF file. 
<br>Javascript is used for a scroll to top button, as the content of each page is quite long. Finally, navigation can be done at the end of each page with the previous/next buttons.
