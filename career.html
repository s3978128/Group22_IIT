            <h2><li>Nguyen Dang Duy Khang (s3979229)</li></h2>
          
            <p>
              My career aspirations involve delving into the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity. I want to gain a deep understanding of security technology to become a security specialist.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a security specialist, I envision myself being responsible for identifying, assessing and mitigating security risks to an organization's information and technology systems. This would involve tasks such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Monitoring the organization's systems continuously to identify and prevent any potential security breaches.

              </li>
              <li>
                Investigating and responding to security incidents in a timely and efficient manner.

              </li>
              <li>
                Developing and implementing security protocols for organizations to secure their assets.

              </li>
              <li>
                Ensuring compliance with current security regulations and standards.

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To excel in this field, I would need to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Have a strong understanding of the current technologies: how the network works under the hood, the security implementation of various corporations like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and cryptography. 

              </li>
              <li>
                Possess strong problem-solving skills, as well as be analytical and detail-oriented. 

              </li>
              <li>
                Have good communication and teamwork skills as I would be working with others to troubleshoot and maintain security.

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I plan to keep up with the latest developments in the field of cybersecurity by:

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attending industry conferences and training programs to strengthen my foundation and skills, as well as keep myself updated on the current landscape.

              </li>
              <li>
                Getting certifications in a relevant area such as Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), or GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH) to strengthen my credentials.

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In my opinion, a career as a security specialist is challenging but rewarding. This is a field that requires constant learning and adaptation to the fast development of technologies. Being a person with an interest in security and enjoys working in a fast-paced environment, I am confident this would most certainly be the right field for me.
            </p>

           
              <h2><li>Comparison between our ideal jobs</li></h2>
            
            <p>
              Although each member of our group has their own vision when it comes to an ideal career, there are some similarities between the roles:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Some skills and knowledge required for each role can be transferable across different positions. For example, all tech positions require problem solving, communication, and technical skills.
              </li>
              <li>
                As with most jobs in the tech industry, all of them are ever-evolving fields that require us to constantly stay on top of the latest technology developments. They all require working with complex software and hardware.
              </li>
              <li>
                Data analysis, cloud computing and cybersecurity all contribute to an organization’s growth by aiding them in different aspects. Both cloud computing and data analysis helps an organization achieve efficiency and achieve cost-effective goals. Cyber security ensures the protection of systems and data and prevents data from breaches or attacks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Data analysis and cloud computing both deal with the handling of data. Both technologies involve storing and accessing data in a secure and efficient way. Both technologies also leverage the use of databases to store data.
              </li>
              <li>
                These job positions are not mutually exclusive. A cloud engineer, for instance, would need some degree of competency in security and vice versa. There are also specialist titles such as cloud security analysts, which incorporates both roles.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It should also be noted that during our research, we have found that job titles in technology fields usually overlap and the work involved in these jobs may not be clearly defined, but depends on the specific company’s needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regarding differences, our ideal jobs also have many distinctions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Difference in the tools and knowledge necessary: Data analysts use software and languages suited to data (Excel, R,...); cloud engineers leverage cloud technologies and services (such as AWS); while cybersecurity specialists mainly use encryption, security testing tools, etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Difference with regards to the responsibilities of the roles, as discussed extensively in our plans. Each of these positions will be managing a different part that correlates to their profession.
              </li>
              <li>
                For example, a cloud engineer would be more infrastructure focused, building and maintaining systems in cloud vendors. A data analyst, like the name suggests, would focus primarily on data as their assets.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              However, ultimately, those jobs are closely linked and fundamentally connected to each other.

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Clouds provide efficient, reliable infrastructure for continuous IT service, while data analysis involves handling data from different sources. Thus, they can go together, as data analysts can utilize the data recorded and tracked in cloud servers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Both cloud networks and data require security to operate safely and efficiently. The role of a cybersecurity professional is to provide the defense so that data is uncompromised and cloud architectures operate normally. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Both cybersecurity and cloud computing facilitate the quality and delivery of data so that it can be processed correctly by data analysts. While data is stored and accessed via the cloud, its integrity and privacy would be protected by cybersecurity specialists.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Even though we would be focusing on learning different technologies and languages in our career plans, the steps we plan on taking are quite similar: acquiring education through multiple means (university, bootcamps, online courses,...), along with gaining practical skills by joining in projects and applying for internships. Finally, we all understand the importance of having a nice portfolio, which means we would be studying for certifications as well as completing technical projects to improve our CV.
