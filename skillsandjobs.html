          With sufficient investment, there could be numerous positions that would help increase the appeal and functionalities of the website, bringing the EFly e-commerce website project to another level. However, the team, as EFly’s founders, must round up the most vital aspects needed for the development of EFly, so the most important positions can be identified. 
<br>After weighing our options, we will prioritize these 5 main positions, provided that we have sufficient funding:

        <ol>
          <h2><li>IT specialists (two people): 
          </li></h2>
          <p>
            The nature of the project obviously means that the competency in the field of Information Technology is undoubtedly valuable. In order to bring the project to the next level, it demands a high level of skill in multiple fields of technology. For this position, we may need to consider more than one person, so the work can be reasonably divided.

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A web developer will be in charge of making the idea of EFly a reality. A web developer will have the following skills:
              <ul>
                <li>Website development: Naturally, as EFly itself is an e-commerce website, the specialist’s proficiency in web development and maintenance would be the backbone of our service.

                <li>
                  Data Structure: The website consists of many utilities, so it is important to have a well structured database for control and implementation.

                </li>
              </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
              A security specialist will be crucial in an e-commerce business. As the website involves databases containing personal information of customers as well as the business’s internal information, developing a secure network is the first thing that must be assured.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Layers of security must be set up and maintained regularly to prevent malicious attacks and unauthorized personnels. Implementing a secure website and protecting customer information will prevent the business from possible PR disasters.

This will help build up the reputation of the website as a reliable platform, therefore attracting more users.
