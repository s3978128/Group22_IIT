          With sufficient investment, there could be numerous positions that would help increase the appeal and functionalities of the website, bringing the EFly e-commerce website project to another level. However, the team, as EFly’s founders, must round up the most vital aspects needed for the development of EFly, so the most important positions can be identified. 
<br>After weighing our options, we will prioritize these 5 main positions, provided that we have sufficient funding: 
        </p>

        <ol>
          <h2><li>IT specialists (two people): 
          </li></h2>
          <p>
            The nature of the project obviously means that the competency in the field of Information Technology is undoubtedly valuable. In order to bring the project to the next level, it demands a high level of skill in multiple fields of technology. For this position, we may need to consider more than one person, so the work can be reasonably divided.

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A web developer will be in charge of making the idea of EFly a reality. A web developer will have the following skills:
              <ul>
                <li>Website development: Naturally, as EFly itself is an e-commerce website, the specialist’s proficiency in web development and maintenance would be the backbone of our service. Bringing utilities and ideas that benefit the development of the website into reality is the key to success.</li>
                <li>
                  UX/UI Design: It is very crucial to create a website that is user-friendly and efficient.

The Digital Marketing Specialist will provide user preferences and help identify current trends, which will serve as a guide for designing the user interface.

                </li>
                <li>
                  Data Structure: The website consists of many utilities, so it is important to have a well structured database for control and implementation. In the long run, the project will be developed even further, which is why it requires a structure that is not only efficient but also scalable when the business develops further.

                </li>
              </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
              A security specialist will be crucial in an e-commerce business. As the website involves databases containing personal information of customers as well as the business’s internal information, developing a secure network is the first thing that must be assured.

            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Layers of security must be set up and maintained regularly to prevent malicious attacks and unauthorized personnels. Implementing a secure website and protecting customer information will prevent the business from possible PR disasters.

              <li>
                The website must be constantly maintained so that there is no glitches or errors. For instance, the total cost of an order or a customer’s address must be stored and updated correctly in the database. This will help build up the reputation of the website as a reliable platform, therefore attracting more users.
