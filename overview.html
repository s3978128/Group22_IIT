          Topic
        </h1>
        <p>
          Our topic for this course is a full stack e-commerce website (official name: EFly), which is a marketplace designed to help RMIT students find, sell and buy their favorite university merchandise. It offers two main features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Shopping Page: A page modeled after a typical business-like e-commerce web, with basic shopping functions (such as viewing items, searching, adding to cart, checkout, watchlist). Registered users can order RMIT’s official items from our website directly. For convenience, guest users who do not register can still buy from this official shop.
          </li>
          <li>
            Auction Page: A page that allows registered users to participate in auctions for RMIT branded items. Users will be allowed to post auction listings, as well as bid for merchandise posted by other users and see the auction results after an auction is closed. This feature is community driven, and strictly limited to registered users. Furthermore, admins will be able to monitor auction listings and make changes as we see fit.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>
          Motivations
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The need/users: University merchandise is a great way to show your support for your school and make a statement about who you are. It also lets us connect with other students and show our support for the school. We aim to develop a website that will make it easier for RMIT students to acquire their favorite items, as well as organize trading in the community.

            The benefits from an educational perspective: This project will be extremely valuable as an educational opportunity.

              Full stack web development is a popular IT profession and most importantly, a shared interest of our members. Web development can closely relate to our ideal careers, such as data analysis or cyber security. For instance, the need to avoid numerous security risks is incredibly important for an e-commerce website to function. Web applications are commonly a target for malicious attacks, being a place that users are familiar with accessing, as stated in [1].
            </li>
            <li>
              E-commerce in general is booming in popularity, attracting a large customer base. In 2015, more than half of all manufacturing activities sales in the United States was attributed to e-commerce, according to [2]. This project can help our group recognize the demonstrated enormous potential of e-commerce through learning about the practicalities involving the technology, for example, how a website can aid in the context of a business, how it can be structured accordingly and how the tools related (such as cookies) can be implemented. 

            </li>
            <li>
              This will be our first step in learning web development. The functionalities of this type of website are already well established, indeed, e-commerce sites are not at all a new invention, however, that also means that we can focus on learning from building familiar web ideas. The vast amount of tutorials and resources online is a testament to this, therefore, it can be guaranteed that we have sufficient and optimal sources to study from. 
            </li>
          </ul>

            The benefits from a career perspective:

              A full-fledged e-commerce website would be an impressive accomplishment to future employers, and would reflect our competence in the industry. By building this website, we can demonstrate our ability to develop a platform that is secure, efficient, and user-friendly, which requires proficiency in different tech fields. Additionally, it shows that we have the ability to troubleshoot issues that may arise, and a good understanding of data security. All in all, EFly would be an impressive addition to our portfolios.

            </li>
            <li>
              Apart from technical skills, EFly would reflect our ability to collaborate in IT projects, as well as our understanding of the current IT landscape. These are skills that would be invaluable in the workplace.

          With the aims in mind, it is important to be aware of our competitors so we can identify what features would make us stand out.

            When it comes to RMIT merchandise in particular, RMIT Melbourne has an official shop, <a href="https://www.campusstore.rmit.edu.au/collections/rmit-merchandise">which can be found here</a>. In fact, this shop is one of our inspirations for this project. However, even though it offers international shipping for most items, the fee can be costly if you order from Vietnam. EFly resolves this problem, by being based in our country. Also, the auction page allows for more flexible exchange of goods between RMIT Vietnam students.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the bigger picture, building an e-commerce website from scratch and getting people to use it is a difficult task, as there are also many competitors in the scene.<br>
            For example, there are platforms such as Shopify or Woocommerce that let people set up their own online stores. However, since students, in most cases, would only want to sell a small number of items, they will likely prefer just selling them in auctions instead of setting up an entire online store. In this regard, EFly is comparably more convenient and would be the preferable option.<br>
            Of course, big, established shopping platforms such as Amazon or Shopee - a popular online shopping page in Vietnam, are also competitors in the scene. Still, as EFly targets a very specific demographic - RMIT students, and is designed with only this demographic in mind, RMIT students will get to enjoy features that directly benefit them, such as an auctioning community of verified students. This is where having a determined customer demographic shines. We would know from the start where to focus our marketing and the development of features.
          <br>Finally, people might prefer the conventional method of posting items on social media, such as Facebook Groups for sales. Despite this, we believe that if implemented and advertised properly, EFly has the potential to become more and more popular among the students, as they begin to see the obvious benefits that EFly has to offer.
