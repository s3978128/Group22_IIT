    <p>Our group work in Assignments and our IT project can be described as both rewarding and challenging. </p>
    <p>After getting to know each other, we recognized that each person brings their own unique skills and perspectives to the table, which is a great thing as we can complement each other’s strength. Based on each person’s individual IT knowledge and preference, we have assigned ourselves parts of the assignment work in a reasonable and clear manner.
    </p>
    <p>
        There were admittedly arguments and disagreements at times, as our work styles and opinions can clash. For example, we had multiple discussions before making the final decision regarding our project’s topic and objectives. Friendly arguments have taught us how to compromise and understand each other’s perspective so that we can work together effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks to open minded communication and our aligned goals, ultimately, we believe these arguments were productive for finding a solution that works for everyone. As we all want to produce the best result for the assignments, we were strict on rules and requirements, especially concerning frequent communication and punctuality. It is everyone’s role to put the utmost effort into our work, communicate if any problems occur, as well as offer mutual support when one needs it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In short, our team worked quite harmoniously, prioritizing communication and effective collaboration above all in order to help the assignments move forward in a positive direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        A more detailed record of what we have done throughout the course of this semester is under the Plans and Progress section. A group reflection that details our own experience is at the end of this report.
